// MARK: - Continuous decorative-animation throttling
//   (ios-power-profile-animation-throttle-reference-ui — Phase 2 C, reference-ui, iOS)
//
// Depends On: ios-power-profile-thermal-core (already committed `616fb0ef`) — this file
// ONLY consumes the existing core `LBPowerProfile` contract; it adds NO core / view-model
// code (dependency direction is one-way `reference-ui → core`).
//
// The continuous (`repeatForever`) decorative animation in this module — the
// long-title marquee scroll (`MarqueeTitleLoopView`) — keeps driving Core Animation
// forever, heating the device during long live sessions. (The unclaimed-win pulse ring
// in `WinEntryView` this gate originally also covered was removed entirely in
// rb-ios-win-entry-restyle; see design/contract/claude-design-sync.md R24.) This gate
// lets that view SKIP starting its driver when
// the device is hot (power profile `conservative`/`survival`), when the user enabled
// Reduce Motion, or when the view is off-screen. It ONLY gates the `withAnimation` start —
// the animated sub-views still instantiate and lay out at their RESTING position, so the
// snapshot golden (captured by `ImageRenderer`, which never fires `.onAppear`) is
// byte-identical.

/// Pure policy — whether a continuous decorative animation SHALL run. Zero rendering,
/// deterministically unit-testable on any Simulator/CI (thermalState never escalates on
/// the Simulator; the tier is supplied as a plain argument here).
///
/// STARTING VALUE — tune (needs on-device / UX calibration):
/// - `reduceMotionEnabled == true` → `false` (accessibility preference wins).
/// - `visible == false` (off-screen) → `false` (don't burn GPU off-screen).
/// - `profile` in `.conservative` / `.survival` (the `.serious`+ heat band, aligned with
///   the core-side "start meaningfully load-shedding at serious" quality cap) → `false`.
/// - `profile` in `.full` / `.reduced` → `true`.
