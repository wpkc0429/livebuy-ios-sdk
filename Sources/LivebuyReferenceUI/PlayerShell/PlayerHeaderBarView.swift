// MARK: - PlayerHeaderBarView — family-1 surface 1 (top-bar chrome)
//
// Spec: `reference-ui-rendering/spec.md` (family-1 player-shell, surface 1)
// Design: rb-ios-player-shell design.md D-2 #1.
//   Mirrors design `LBPTopBar` / `LBPHostBadge`
//   (sdk-components.jsx): a pinned top bar with a glassy host pill (avatar + title
//   + host name + LIVE pill + viewer count + subscribe affordance) on the leading
//   edge, and a cluster of round glass icon buttons (info / share / mute / close)
//   on the trailing edge, over a top-down dark scrim gradient.
//
// This is family-1 SURFACE 1. It follows the documented SUB-VIEW INPUT PATTERN
// from `PlayerShellView.swift` EXACTLY:
//   1. `theme: ReferenceUITheme` — FIRST positional argument, always.
//   2. The bound SNAPSHOT VALUES it renders (title / hostName / shopLogo /
//      viewerCount / isSubscribed / muted / shareUrl), passed BY VALUE.
//   3. Optional action closures, trailing, each defaulting to `nil`. The shell
//      does NOT own actions — the host wires taps to core `simulate*` (D-4).
//
// It reads ONLY its passed-in values (one-way data flow, D-1/D-4): it never
// reaches back into `PlayerShellModel` or `DefaultPlayerTemplate`, and it renders
// correctly with EVERY action closure nil (so demo / snapshot tests construct it
// action-free).
//
// iOS-14-safe: uses only `ZStack` / `VStack` / `HStack` / `Text` / `Image(systemName:)`
// / `LinearGradient` / `Capsule` / `Circle` — all iOS-13+. The only API that needs
// an `@available` guard (`.foregroundStyle`) is intentionally NOT used; we use the
// iOS-13-safe `.foregroundColor` throughout (D-7).

// MARK: - LBVideoTitleScroll — the single fallback entry point (normalizeTitleScroll)

/// Turns the RAW wire value of `POST /sdk/config` → `data.extensions.video_title_scroll` into the
/// `Bool` that `LivebuyPlayerConfig.titleScroll` takes. The iOS counterpart of the design's
/// `normalizeTitleScroll` (`design/templates/minimal/sdk-components.jsx`, R15).
///
/// `extensions` is an OPAQUE RAW BAG: the `sdk-config` capability forbids the SDK from interpreting
/// any key in it, so core never normalizes this value and never applies the backend's default. The
/// host reads it (`sdkConfig.extensions["video_title_scroll"]?.value` — one `AnyEquatable` unwrap)
/// and hands it here. That makes THIS layer the owner of the malformed-value fallback, which is why
/// the rule lives in reference-ui rather than in core or in each host.
///
/// Deliberately uninhabited (a namespace, not a state): the domain is genuinely binary, so wrapping
/// the answer in a two-case enum would only add a conversion hop between the config field and the
/// view without buying any type safety.

    /// ONLY `false`, the number `0`, and the string `"0"` spelled verbatim mean "do not scroll".
    ///
    /// Everything else lands on `true` — the absent key, JSON `null` (`NSNull`), `1`, `"1"`, `""`,
    /// `" 0 "`, `"false"`, and any unexpected type. The comparison is STRICT: no trimming, no case
    /// folding, no alias table, exactly like `LBProductCardMode.normalized(_:)` and
    /// `LBFloatingEntryPosition.normalized(_:)`. Being deliberately as strict as the design keeps
    /// the four platforms' fallback boundary identical precisely when the backend emits something
    /// malformed — which is when a divergence would be hardest to spot. The backend passes
    /// `extensions` through raw and normalizes nothing (the source is a JSON column that can hold
    /// legacy or hand-edited values), so this really does happen.
    ///
    /// The fallback lands on `true` (scrolling) on purpose: that is the side the backend's own
    /// default (`1`, when the merchant never set it) is on, AND the side this module behaved on
    /// before the setting existed — so an unset / malformed value costs an existing host nothing.
    ///
    /// ⚠️ `false` means "do not scroll", NOT "do not show" — see `PlayerHeaderBarView.titleScroll`.

    /// Type notes (why the cases are in this order):
    ///   - `Bool` first absorbs the `NSNumber` values JSON decoding produces for `0` / `1`, both of
    ///     which bridge to `Bool`; that avoids leaning on `Int` bridging subtleties for the two
    ///     values that actually matter. `NSNumber(2)` does NOT bridge to `Bool` and falls through
    ///     to the `Int` case → `2 != 0` → `true`, matching JS's `2 !== 0`.
    ///   - The `Double` case exists for a Swift-native `0.0` (which `as? Int` would reject); JS
    ///     treats `0.0 === 0` as true, so both land on "do not scroll".
    ///   - A host that forgets the `.value` unwrap and hands over the `AnyEquatable` wrapper hits
    ///     `default` → `true`: the setting silently fails OPEN (title still scrolls) rather than
    ///     doing something destructive.

    // already-shipped Android port. Closes a documented design/implementation gap: the

    // overflows AND the backend/merchant setting allows scrolling
    // (`titleScroll`, rb-ios-video-title-scroll — design `LBPHostBadge`'s `titleScroll` prop).

    /// The title slot. The layout-participating (and therefore negotiation-affecting)
    /// view is ALWAYS the exact same unconstrained, static `Text` this rendered before
    /// this change — same modifiers, no `.frame`, no wrapper — so it hugs/squeezes in
    /// the surrounding `HStack`/`VStack` negotiation IDENTICALLY to before this change,
    /// for every title, every time. Zero behavior change / byte-identical for the
    /// common (fits) case, guaranteed structurally, not just by a threshold check.
    ///
    /// The marquee, when needed, is attached as an `.overlay` — a PURELY VISUAL
    /// addition that does not feed back into the base `Text`'s own reported size (this
    /// is what makes it safe: an EARLIER attempt that instead swapped the
    /// layout-participating view itself between the static `Text` and a
    /// `.frame`-sized `MarqueeTitleLoopView` was found, by direct empirical testing, to
    /// perturb the surrounding pill's negotiation — the fixed-frame marquee refused to
    /// shrink under squeeze the way the original elastic `Text` did, redirecting that
    /// squeeze pressure onto the host-name row below instead and spuriously
    /// over-truncating it).
    ///
    /// The overlay's content is `GeometryReader` — used here specifically because
    /// `.overlay(_:alignment:)` proposes its content the SAME size the base `Text`
    /// itself resolved to (post-squeeze, if any), and `GeometryReader`'s closure can
    /// read that proposed size and decide what to render SYNCHRONOUSLY, in the exact
    /// same pass — no `@State` / `.onPreferenceChange` round trip needed. An earlier
    /// attempt used this module's established `.background(GeometryReader {
    /// ... }.preference(...))` + `.onPreferenceChange` measuring idiom instead (as used
    /// elsewhere in this module for other views), which requires an `@State` write to
    /// trigger a SECOND render pass before the measurement is available — and whether
    /// `ImageRenderer` (this module's snapshot mechanism) performs that second
    /// settling pass within one synchronous capture was found, by direct empirical
    /// testing, to be UNPREDICTABLE across otherwise-equivalent view shapes. Reading
    /// the proposed size directly inside the overlay's own `GeometryReader` sidesteps
    /// that non-determinism entirely — no second pass is ever required.
    ///
    /// The OVERFLOW decision stays purely content-driven — no caller preference can stand in for
    /// the measurement. On top of it sits ONE backend/merchant capability gate, `titleScroll`
    /// (rb-ios-video-title-scroll); the two are ANDed in the single pure entry point
    /// `showsMarqueeTitle(titleScroll:textWidth:containerWidth:)`, which is the ONLY thing that
    /// decides whether the overlay paints.
    ///
    /// WHY `titleScroll == false` CANNOT CHANGE THE LINE HEIGHT (structural, not tuned):
    /// disabling the marquee means the `.overlay` is simply not attached. The
    /// layout-participating view — the `Text` below — is byte-identical in BOTH states (same font,

// duplicate the text with a gap, animate a seamless leftward loop; parity the
// already-shipped Android `MarqueeLoop`). Follows this module's own established
// continuous-loop idiom (`SpinnerRingView.swift`'s `@State` + `.onAppear` +
// `withAnimation(.linear(duration:).repeatForever(autoreverses: false))`, also used by
// `WinEntryView.swift`'s pulse and `StartScreenView.swift`'s spinner) rather than
// introducing a new animation mechanism — a `Timer`-driven frame clock
// (`LoadingMarkAnimationView.swift`'s idiom) is the wrong tool here: that exists for
// *discrete* PNG-sequence frame stepping, whereas this is *continuous* interpolated
// motion, which `withAnimation(...repeatForever...)` handles natively.

// Under `ImageRenderer` (this module's snapshot mechanism, `ReferenceUISnapshotHelper`),
// `.onAppear` does not fire (established precedent — see `SpinnerRingView.swift`'s doc
// comment, empirically reconfirmed for this change: `AddToCartSheetViewSnapshotTests
// .testAddToCartSheetView_loadingState_rendersDeterministically`, which renders
