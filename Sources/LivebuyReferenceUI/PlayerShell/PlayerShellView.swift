// MARK: - PlayerShellView — family-1 player-shell container (SKELETON)
//
// Spec: `reference-ui-rendering/spec.md` (family-1 player-shell, 4 surfaces)
// Design: rb-ios-player-shell design.md D-1 / D-2 / D-7.
//
// The top-level family-1 container. It lays out the FOUR family-1 surface
// sub-views over a video area:
//
//   1. PlayerHeaderBarView    — pinned TOP        (D-2 #1, `LBPTopBar` / `LBPHostBadge`)
//   2. OperationRailView      — pinned TRAILING   (D-2 #2, `LBPSideRail`)
//   3. VideoInfoPanelView     — bottom-sheet      (D-2 #3, `LBPBottomSheet`)
//   4. LiveOverlayChromeView  — full-bleed overlay (D-2 #4, `live-chrome.jsx`)
//
// This is the SKELETON: it owns the layout + a `PlayerShellModel` + the resolved
// `ReferenceUITheme`, and composes the four surface sub-views BY TYPE NAME. The
// four sub-view TYPES are produced by the four parallel surface agents that run
// after this skeleton — see the "SUB-VIEW INPUT PATTERN" contract below, which
// every surface agent MUST implement verbatim so the container's call sites match.
//
// Until all four surface sub-views exist, this file will not compile on its own —
// that is expected (the surface agents land the types). The container's job is to
// FIX the layout + the call-site shape so the parallel agents converge.
//
// iOS-14-safe: `ZStack` / `VStack` / `HStack` / `Spacer` / `safeAreaInset`-free
// manual padding are all iOS-13+; no `@available` guard needed. Any surface that
// reaches for a >14 API must guard it inside its own sub-view (D-7).
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// SUB-VIEW INPUT PATTERN — the contract the 4 parallel surface agents MUST follow
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every family-1 surface sub-view is a `public struct …: View` whose initializer
// takes, IN THIS ORDER:
//
//   1. `theme: ReferenceUITheme`            — the resolved reference-ui theme
//                                             (FIRST positional argument, always).
//   2. its bound SNAPSHOT VALUE(S)          — the read-only state it renders,
//                                             passed BY VALUE from PlayerShellModel
//                                             (never the model, never the template).
//   3. optional action closures            — trailing, each defaulting to `nil`
//                                             (`onX: (() -> Void)? = nil`, etc.).
//                                             The shell does NOT own actions; the
//                                             host wires taps to core `simulate*`.
//
// Concretely, the four surface agents implement EXACTLY these initializers:
//
//   PlayerHeaderBarView(
//       theme: ReferenceUITheme,
//       title: String, hostName: String, shopLogo: String,
//       viewerCount: Int, isSubscribed: Bool, isLive: Bool,
//       onMinimize: (() -> Void)? = nil,
//       onSubscribe: (() -> Void)? = nil)
//   (top-right = a single minimize button → onMinimize; LIVE pill + viewer count
//    shown only when isLive. mute/share/info are NOT header controls.)
//
//   OperationRailView(
//       theme: ReferenceUITheme,
//       items: [LBSideRailItem], bagCount: Int, heartBurstTick: Int, muted: Bool,
//       onTapItem: ((LBSideRailKind) -> Void)? = nil)
//
//   VideoInfoPanelView(
//       theme: ReferenceUITheme,
//       info: LBInfoTabState, activeTab: LBInfoPanelTab,
//       canOpenNotice: Bool, systemNotice: String, notice: String,
//       onSelectTab: ((LBInfoPanelTab) -> Void)? = nil)
//
//   LiveOverlayChromeView(
//       theme: ReferenceUITheme,
//       announceText: String, pinnedProduct: LBProduct?,
//       hostCaption: String = "", showGestureHints: Bool = true)
//
// Rules every surface agent honours:
//   • FIRST positional arg is `theme:`. Snapshot values are passed BY VALUE.
//   • Action closures are LAST, each `… = nil` (the shell passes the host-wired
//     closure or omits it). A surface sub-view MUST render correctly with all
//     actions nil (so demo / snapshot tests construct it action-free).
//   • A surface sub-view reads ONLY its passed-in values — it MUST NOT reach back
//     into PlayerShellModel or DefaultPlayerTemplate (one-way data flow, D-1/D-4).
//   • iOS-14-safe SwiftUI only; any >14 API guarded with `@available` /
//     `if #available` inside the sub-view (D-7).
