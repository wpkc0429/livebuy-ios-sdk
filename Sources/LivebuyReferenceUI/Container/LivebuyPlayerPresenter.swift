// MARK: - LivebuyPlayerPresenter — collapsible player presentation convenience
//
// Spec: `reference-ui-rendering/spec.md`
//   § "LivebuyReferenceUI 提供 collapsible 播放器 presenter（一行 sheet + minimize→懸浮預覽）".
//
// `LivebuyPlayer` is a `UIViewControllerRepresentable` — the host decides HOW it is
// presented, so the container cannot own the minimize→floating-preview collapse (it can
// neither dismiss its presenter nor raise a sibling overlay in the host's tree). That is
// why `LivebuyPlayer.onMinimize` defaults to the core `player.minimize()` seam and each
// host re-implements the in-app floating preview itself.
//
// This modifier PROMOTES that wiring into the package: `someHostView.livebuyPlayer(video:
// $presented)` gives a host a full-screen turnkey player that collapses to a floating
// `FloatingWidgetView` on minimize — in ONE line. The resting corner defaults to bottom-right
// and, since rb-ios-floating-widget-position, can be switched to bottom-left via the `position`
// parameter (host-injected raw `extensions.floating_setting.position`). It composes ONLY
// existing pieces (`LivebuyPlayer` + the family-5 `FloatingWidgetView` + the sibling
// `LivebuyLiveEntry`'s `LBFloatingEntryPosition`); it adds NO view-model, NO pixels, and does
// NOT change `LivebuyPlayer`. Dependency direction stays one-way `reference-ui → template → core`.

/// The presentation phase of a collapsible player, derived purely from the host binding +
/// the minimized flag (extracted for unit testing — internal-testability).
public enum CollapsiblePlayerPhase: Equatable {
    /// No session (`video == nil`).
    case closed
    /// Full-screen player presented.
    case full
    /// Collapsed to the floating preview (resting corner driven by `position`, default
    /// bottom-right).
    case floating
}

/// Pure phase derivation: no video → closed; minimized → floating; else full. The SwiftUI
/// wiring is a thin shell around this so the state logic is deterministically testable.

///
/// `covered ⟺ phase == .full` (i.e. `hasVideo && !isMinimized`). The full-screen player is a
/// KEEP-ALIVE overlay (`playerLayer`): while `.full` it is decoding a live/VOD stream and, being
/// kept alive, KEEPS decoding even after minimize — so the N home carousel previews (each its own
/// `AVQueuePlayer`) contend for the finite hardware video decoders and stall. Declaring the home
/// previews COVERED only while `.full` makes them yield those decoders; on minimize (`.floating`)
/// the previews resume (still gated by foreground / on-screen) because the small floating card
/// alone frees enough decoding headroom, and `.closed` has no session. This is what fixes
/// "shrink the full-screen live player → home previews still don't play": the residual gap left by
/// `ios-refui-widget-host-visibility-pause` (the bridge existed but NOTHING in production ever
/// called `setWidgetsCovered`, since only THIS presenter knows the full/floating/closed phase —
